## Summary

A logout function is needed to properly close a session. Giving the user the option to end their session reduces the time an attacker has to steal the session from another attack.

## Capabilities and Risk

If a session is not properly closed, it increases the likelyhood that the session can be hijacked logically or physically.

A hijacked session can lead to loss of data integrity, confidentialty and availability.

## Detection

The application should have a visable logout button.

## Remediation

A logout button should be included to ensure that user sessions can properly terminate.

## Exploitation

If a session is not properly closed, its possible a malicious actor can hijack a session. There are two ways a session can be hijacked: physically and logically.

###Logically

Another vulnerability (e.g. cross-site scripting )is required to hijack the session. 

###Physically

If a user leaves their workstation unlocked, it may be possible for an attacker to use a browser's back button to successfully access the applicaion.
